* Added and updated a lot of sounds.
* Achievements!
* HUD updates
* 3-slot vehicle weapons + research
* And a lot more: [see the full release notes.](https://wiki.empiresmod.com/Version/2.11.x)

We also wanted to give you something else for the holidays, so we decided to open our script repository to the public. This means that you can see the full history of all script changes and go back in history to see what values were used before. You can view [the scripts here.](https://git.empiresmod.com/empires_public/empires_scripts)

Happy holidays from the Dev Team!
