We've opened up beta testing to the public - you can opt in by right-clicking Empires in the games list, selecting properties, going to BETAS tab and selecting beta from the dropdown. After updating, you will be testing our next version for us! Thank you in advance for your help.

You can start your own server and test building placement any time, and [submit bugs in the 2.8.1 bugtest thread](https://forums.empiresmod.com/index.php?threads/sat-april-30th-7pm-utc-empires-2-8-1-bugtest.20150/). We're also organising a test on the Nubs testing server on Saturday April 30th 7pm UTC - please let us know in [that same thread](https://forums.empiresmod.com/index.php?threads/sat-april-30th-7pm-utc-empires-2-8-1-bugtest.20150/) if you are coming.

[See the testing discussion forum for much more information.](https://forums.empiresmod.com/index.php?forums/testing-discussion.33/)

P.S. To speed up your testing, open the developer console (check it on in multiplayer options, then press ~ (tilde, left of number keys)) and do `exec testing` so you can cheat.
