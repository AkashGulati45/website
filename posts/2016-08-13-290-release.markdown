Empires 2.9.0 "Battery"
August 13, 2016

* Features:
Linux client and server, including [easy installation using LGSM](https://gameservermanagers.com/lgsm/emserver/)
Building upgrades are now split into their own script definitions which allows values to be overridden when a building upgrades. For example turret damage can now be set when it is upgraded.
Removed various code restrictions that meant only turrets could be upgraded. This means that new building upgrade definitions are now a possibility.
Maximum carcass health is now defined in scripts, defaults to vehicle health.
Concussion grenades re-added.
Resource income now displays total income from all captured refineries and flags without using averaging; this should make it easier to notice when your income changes without random fluctuations. Resource deductions will display as and when they occur.
Resources and wages will now display as rounded figures. This helps to make sure all the information stays visible without overlapping or going off-screen.
Removed hardcoded layout for hud ammo indicator.
Standing near an unbuilt refinery point shows a hint that you have to move away.

* Bugfixes:
Made walls placable in Hammer.
Fixed the bug causing players to spawn in Barracks facing East; players will now spawn facing the nearest exit.
Fixed a bug where an engineer could place small walls even though they hit their limit.
Fixed persistent wall ghosts when holstering engineer tool.
Fixed a bug where the start position of a wall would be the map origin, meaning players would be unable to place a wall until they right clicked.
Engineer recycling no longer gives more resources when recycling without repair upgrade.
Turrets upgrade instantly after turret upgrade research.
Fixed scout class being named assault at the end of a round.
Removed unused emp_sv_refinery_interval cvar.
Made default class on start of game engineer instead of scout.
Fixed guard order drawing outline with an extra side.
Fixed gui images becoming blurry on low graphics settings.
Intro video has been fixed.
Hints should no longer show when inside a vehicle; destroyed vehicles show their own hint.
Engineer buildables no longer block building placement for commander.
Fixed news panel in menu.

* Non-code changes:
Added emp_money_2016 with prebuilt walls on the entrances.
Fixed third flag on emp_escort giving Brenodi reinforcements multiple times.
Added ocean water material for use in mapping.
Improved NF jeep VGUI images.
Hud style updated.
Updated some collisions for old Brenodi props.
