I'm so excited! [This pull request](https://github.com/EmpiresCommunity/website/pull/3) makes us officially the first gaming website that is community-built; before, some of the developers perhaps made changes, but now, Lalaland has proven that anyone with a github account and basic knowledge of text editing can fix anything they want to on the website!

So please, honour Empiresmod, write game-reviews together, comparing features of other games with those in Empiresmod, fix typos on the website, make everything look *just right* - edit my words mercilessly, and make Empiresmod what you know it once was; full of life, full of players, full of passion! Long live zombie Empiresmod!
