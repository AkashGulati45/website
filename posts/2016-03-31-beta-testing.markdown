title: Public script testing on Friday 1st April, 7PM GMT.

April 1st always brings out the best in Empires devs, don't you think? As you can see, we've fixed building placement and added some hints for noobs (you can turn them off in Multiplayer options), but that's not why I'm inviting you all to test on april fool's day. The balancing is also taking a turn for the better - we hope the changes we have planned will increase the variety of play, bringing back some lesser-used features, balancing the weapons, and giving them more strategical differences.
